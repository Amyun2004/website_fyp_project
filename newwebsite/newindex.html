                <h3> This website is my fyp project</h3>
                <p>I was initally about to do a mashup video, was nearly done to be precise, but I scratched that idea.<br>
                    It just didn’t feel like me, so I just thought that doing something geeky would be more like me. Hence,<br>
                     I thought of a website, where I would just show the songs and the reason and the way the songs represent me.
                     <br>Now, that would be both geeky and represent me.</p>

                <h4>Section that I can relate to</h4>
                <p>Man, I feel like mold <br>
                    It's prom night and I am lonely <br>
                    Lo and behold <br>
                    She's walkin' over to me <br>
                    This must be fake <br>
                    My lip starts to shake <br>
                    How does she know who I am? <br>
                    And why does she give a damn about me? <br>
                    I’ve got two tickes to Iron Maiden, baby <br>
                    Come with me Friday, don’t say maybe <br>
                    I’m just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you, ooh
                    </p>
                <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
                <p>This part from this song “I am just a teenage dirt bag baby” is something that I can relate to. Rather than relate, I feel like this has happened to me, I don’t mean to say that my high school cursh walked up to me, and we had a prom night. Nope, that didn’t happen, but I can imagine myself, thinking/imagining of the same thing happening to me. Not just me, I think every early to mid-teen boy has had at least one of those dreamy moments. 
                    Just thinking about the girl, walking up to me, or vice versa, having a dance, then going on dates, having those iconic early teen fun, that used to be the main thing going on in my head, had no other thing to worry about (besides my exam and tests). Having those awkward conversations with the girl I liked, this part just reminds me of that.

                <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
                <p>The song is about two people singing and expressing their love to 
                    each other in the old cultural way a lot of people do it back home
                    ,that is, our own old duet songs. The love part is not the reason
                    why I chose this song, I chose this song because, this reminds me
                    of the time I used just put this song on and think about random things like
                    how I am going to be someone big, or just imagine playing or reading something in 
                    such a complex manner people would get flabbergasted, or just play this song in the 
                    background and start drawing random things when I used to get too stressed, 
                    or when I was in a break. This song just used to be my special place,
                     I didn’t understand the meaning of the song back then, but just enjoyed this
                      songs company, OHh those simple days.

                <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
                <p>This song is once again about love, but the love part is very descriptive and open to interpretation. Back when I was in high school, 
                    I could not interpret it and used to think that this is just a love song, but weirdly this remined me of my little sister, so, when I missed her
                     during my boarding school period my junior and senior year of high school, where I was allowed to meet my family only once a month, I used to put
                      this song on and just listen to it, while laying down in my bed or at my high school, middle pitch, it was similar to greens view, a lot more taller trees a lot more open,
                     it had a bench and I would just sit and look at the sun from morning to sunset, or just sit there with my friends arguing about silly things( I think the things are silly now, 
                     but not back then I though they were serious stuff), with the song playing in the background, thinking about what I will do after high school ( which never happened, kind of happened 
                     not in the way I was expecting).

                <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
                <p>This song is mixture of folklore, rituals, and expressions of confusion or indecision, possibly reflecting someone’s inner conflict between duty, desire, and the unpredictability of life. This part is basically like the representation of the song’s energetic nature, this is just about being young and unpredictable, being young and indecisive, being young and idiotic in a fun way. This song is just a vibe and used to be a song that I would pretty much dance to all the time, not just me play this song to any Nepali and he/she/they will jump, and dace, a text or sentence or a paragraph is not enough to explain the energy this song gives to people.
                    I used to play this song when going out in my earphones and dancing all the way to places. This song is one of the songs that got me though the most hectic part of my life, my CAIE A-levels exams. I know it’s not that big of a deal compared to other people’s hard times/ hardships, but I feel like back than this song was the definition of my life, how used to live my life by, and the song which helped me live through those hectic exams.

                <p>This song represents the part for me in my high school where I used to sit in the middle pitch, or in my boarding room in my hostel, (room 51) and started to take guitar seriously again, after 1 year of not playing it at all because it was too hard. I feel like this song inspired me to work on things that I feel are hard, and did not continue, or just as a whole complete the things that I started, even now if I am stuck on something, and am not inspired to do something, I listen to this song and try my best to do it. 
                    <br>Also, the lyrics is about a person and their lover, but in my case this song also represents and signifies my love towards guitar and music, and some of my happy places, room 51 and my room back in my parents’ house, where I learned the most about music and myself.

This song just reminds me of the innocent guy that I used to be. I didn’t understand anything, no politics, no relationship things, no values, anything, I just used to follow things and not question them, didn’t understand them just followed them, and like a kid did rebel, sometimes, against it without thinking about the consequences I would face. Didn’t know how to talk to people,
                    how to hold a conversation; was scared to ask questions to my teachers, just went along with my friends’ plans. That was my life back then.

                <p>This song basically represents my time when I was fresh out of high school. For the first time in my life I was free to do, and actually has things I needed to worry about, I didn’t talk to my friends much, didn’t contact them at all for 2-3 months was just doing nothing. I didn’t know how to make friends, how to talk to people, how to do anything at all. I was lonely, and then I discovered this song, and I just used to play this song on repeat, 
                    and used to hope for a better future, which I did get.
                     I learned to get out of my comfort zone, learned to be happy when I am alone instead of lonely.

                    When I first heard this song, I teared up a bit, because I imagined myself in this song’s situation, and then this part showed me the things from a parent’s perspective. That’s when I learned how to look though parents’ perspective, that’s when I realized that they are also human beings, they also have feelings, they also had hard decisions to make. I just thought about my parents and started wondering what things they had to sacrifice for me and my sister. Also, I realized I will sacrifice things for my sister if needed, and, if I ever have, 
                    for my children’s sake as well. This song made me a more diverse thinker.

I remember my dad playing this song, I don’t know if it was intentionally or unintentionally that he played it, when he was bringing me back home from my last day in high school (the next day of my final exam). This part specifically struck me down. As, I was free now, but I was scared and wanted my parents to do literally the things that are told in the lyrics. But then I realized that I am a 16-year-old dude, I need to learn to be independent soon, I need to spread my wings and learn to fly.  This song, specifically this stanza made me realize that this will
                     stick with me my whole life and remember my last day as a high school student

                <p>This whole song is an art, straight up art. I found this song by mistake when I was searching for some other song, and I was … surprised. The story telling, the emotional setting and everything was just surprising. 
                    <br>I have a lot of rap songs in my list which have been iconic, for me personally, including Nepali rap songs, but after I found out about Dance with the devil, everything else had to be cutoff, once again for me personally. The primary reason being, it at the end warned and taught me things that I live by, my beliefs, and the things I like to follow. This one hit very very deep, it teaches us to anticipate things by looking at things widely, by being careful on things that one does or plan to do. The whole song is special to me because this song helps me realize and shows me the reality of the whole world that we are living in; that the reality is not just me. There are people with the worst problems. This song warns of many things, especially for young people like me – peer pressure.

                <p>“older” tells us about an important part of not just my life, but everybody’s life. The moment one moves out of our parent’s home and starts living alone, without depending on anyone. The stanza that I cut out is I think the most important one, because it tells us what comes when you move out, and what we should expect when living independently. I found out about this song, on Spotify, when I was living alone for 3 months away from my parents on an unknown place, during my gap year post high school. This song was so relatable that it straight went to my favorites. 
                    <br>Even, when I was coming to Sewanee, I was listening to this song, and soothing myself, that this needs to be done, I need to be away from my parents and cannot keep living under their wing. I need to do the 3 months thing for my whole life form now onwards. The soothing worked, and I feel more independent and must be more independent.

                    ---
                    
                    It feels like there has been a long silence here, like a dark cloud has settled in.  <br>
                    Hey friend, where are you? Please say something; it’s been hard to spend these long days.  <br>
                    We used to play in that alley, having fun together, oh how joyful it was.  <br>
                    Where are we today? My heart is longing for my childhood.  <br>
                    I am searching for the days gone by, where has my youth gone?  <br>
                    The road is clear, but we shouldn’t lose hope in meeting each other.  <br>
                    <br>Ooo ooo ooooo <br> 
                    Ohhh ohhh ohhhhh  <br>
                    <br>It’s bright here, but I can see you from there too.  <br>
                    Shining bright, oh my dear friend, I can’t get close to you.  <br>
                    On the path of life, we must navigate through sunshine and shade.  <br>
                    Since childhood, we have studied and moved forward together, but now we must part.<br>  
                    Some want to become great people, while others wish to spend time together.  <br>
                    Life goes on just like that, but it’s easy if we are friends.  <br>
                    <br>Oooo ooo ooooo  <br>
                    Ohhh ohhh ohhhhh  <br>
                    <br>Memories of those moments are yet to fade.  <br>
                    We may not be together, but we will always be with each other in spirit.  <br>
                    Memories of those moments are yet to fade.  <br>
                    We may not be together, but we will always be with each other in spirit. <br>
                    It feels like there has been a long silence here, like a dark cloud has settled in. <br>
          
                <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
                <p>“Sathi” is a song about a friend and that friend is singing 
                    for his other friend who is far away from him. This song is not that special song, but my friends back home were special, so much so that we met daily for 4 years and still had stuff to talk about, in our regular place, Café Kunz. Small place, with some really hard couches, but good food and close to everybody’s work place, all 3 of us. This song reminds me of them. Reminds me how happy I get when I get to be in a call with them, I don’t like talking about my friends like this but, I miss them, and Kunz a lot. And I am really appreciating the fact that we spent such a long time together before all three of us separating, and going our own ways.
